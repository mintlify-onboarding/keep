## Connecting with the Provider

To connect to Axiom, you need to create an API token from your Axiom account. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Axiom account.
2. Go to the **API Access** page under the **Settings** menu.
3. Click the **Create Token** button and enter a name for the token.
4. Copy the token value and keep it safe.
5. Add the token value to the `authentication` section in the Axiom Provider configuration.

To access datasets, you need to provide the organization ID. You can find your organization ID in the URL of the Axiom web app. For example, if your Axiom URL is `https://app.axiom.co/organizations/1234`, then your organization ID is `1234`.
