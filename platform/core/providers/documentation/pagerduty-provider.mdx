## Connecting with the Provider

To use the PagerdutyProvider, you'll need to provide either a routing_key or an api_key.

You can find your integration key or routing key in the PagerDuty web app under **Configuration** > **Integrations**, and select the integration you want to use.
You can find your API key in the PagerDuty web app under **Configuration** > **API Access**.

The routing_key is used to post events to Pagerduty using the events API.
The api_key is used to create incidents using the incidents API.

## Notes

The provider uses either the events API or the incidents API to create an alert or an incident. The choice of API to use is determined by the presence of either a routing_key or an api_key.
