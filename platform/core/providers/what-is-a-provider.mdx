description: "A Provider is a component of Keep that enables it to interact with third-party products. It is implemented as extensible Python code, making it easy to enhance and customize."
---

Providers are core components of Keep that allow Keep to either query data or send notifications to products such as Datadog, Cloudwatch, and Sentry for data querying, and Slack, Email, and PagerDuty for sending notifications about alerts.

By leveraging Keep Providers, developers are able to integrate Keep with the tools they use and trust, providing them with a flexible and powerful way to manage their alerts.
